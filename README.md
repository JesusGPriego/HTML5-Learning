# HTML5-Learning
In this repository I'll be uploading what I learn about HTML5 (and some css / JS)

# HTMLFirstsSteps
In this lesson i've learnt basics html5 tags (header, nav, aside, section, footer),
and some basic CSS3.

# ExerciseHTMLandCSS

This is a simple photo gallery made just using html and css3.
It is though no fully responsive (the bigget the screen is, the worse), 
but for what I've tested, it would work fine in mobile devices.
