# HTML5-Learning
In this repository I'll be uploading what I learn about HTML5 (and some css / JS)

# HTMLFirstsSteps
In this lesson i've learnt basics html5 tags (header, nav, aside, section, footer),
and some basic CSS3.

# ExerciseHTMLandCSS

This is a simple photo gallery made just using html and css3.
It is though no fully responsive (the bigget the screen is, the worse), 
but for what I've tested, it would work fine in mobile devices.

# HTMLAndJS:

In this lesson I've learnt the 'basics' of JS and I have applied some functions 
to some page elements.

Since I'm familiar with OOP this was a piece of cake, but still interesting.

In the near future I'm doing a full JS course, so I'll learn it deeper.

Basically I've learnt:
* addEventListener.
* element targetting with getElementBy...,  and qerySelector(All).

Nothing complex here, just a little display.

# HTMLVideo

In this lesson I've learnt how to add video to html file, an also
set custom controllers (with css) to it with functions (with JS) like:
* play
* pause
* Seek

# HTMLAdio

Same as I did with video, but using audio.

# HTMLForms

In this lesson I've learnt new HTML5 form tags and attributes.
These 'new' tags make it easier to validate forms, which is always nice!
I've also learnt about datalists, but it requires some CSS to works as intended (At least in Firefox).

# HTMLApiForms.

In this lesson I've learnt how to validate Forms using HTML5 attributes and JS(using Api Form).

Features:

* 'real time validation'
* validation on submit.
* validation on load
* validation on "invalid" form event.
