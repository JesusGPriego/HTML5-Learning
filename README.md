# HTML5-Learning
In this repository I'll be uploading what I learn about HTML5 (and some css / JS)

# HTMLFirstsSteps
In this lesson i've learnt basics html5 tags (header, nav, aside, section, footer),
and some basic CSS3.

# ExerciseHTMLandCSS

This is a simple photo gallery made just using html and css3.
It is though no fully responsive (the bigget the screen is, the worse), 
but for what I've tested, it would work fine in mobile devices.

# HTMLAndJS:

In this lesson I've learnt the 'basics' of JS and I have applied some functions 
to some page elements.

Since I'm familiar with OOP this was a piece of cake, but still interesting.

In the near future I'm doing a full JS course, so I'll learn it deeper.

Basically I've learnt:
* addEventListener.
* element targetting with getElementBy...,  and qerySelector(All).

Nothing complex here, just a little display.
